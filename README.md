## Features
The main objective of this app is being practical and useful with a simple design. Here are all features of the app. 
* Play the metronome at any tempo user wants between 40 and 200.
* Slide to increase or decrease the metronome bpm.
* Reset all settings (tempo) to its default.
* Show info sheet.

Other features are going to be implemented in the app as well. Here are some that are currently in my wishlist.
* An onboarding view for new users showing a welcome message and the app features.
* Customize the icon app and theme.
* Save all settings to cloud.
